## The Code for _Byte-Pair Encoding for Text-to-SQL Generation_

This is the code we used to conduct the experiments for the paper.
If you want to use BPE encodings for your own projects on SQL data, please check the little [doc](sqlbpe/README.md) on it.
If you are using torchtext you might also find some functions in `utils.py` helpful.
